# Wireless-Sensor-Network
Implement an algorithm for determining a coloring, terminal clique, and a selection of bipartite subgraphs that are produced by an algorithm for graph coloring in a random geometric Graph (RGG). These results model a wireless sensor network (WSN) with each bipartite subgraph providing a communication backbone.
